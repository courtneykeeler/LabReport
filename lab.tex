\section{Introduction}

Electrocardiography (ECG) amplifiers are common  medical devices that are used to measure the electrical activity of a patient's heart. The body surface potentials that are physically measured by the device are very small in amplitude, and therefore require an amplifier that attenuates noise while amplifying the desired signal, all while protecting both the patient and the instrument. In this lab, an ECG amplifier circuit was analyzed, built, and verified on a patient in the lab.

\section{Design and Simulation}

The basic requirements for ECG circuitry are high input impedance, high gain for the desired frequency range, and high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). These parameters are set by the circuit designer through choice of component values. The final component values are summarized in Table \ref{table:values}. Component labels correspond to those shown in Figure \ref{fig:circuit},  the overall schematic of the ECG amplifier circuit.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.35]{ECG_circuit.png}
\caption{Schematic of the circuitry used to amplify ECG signals in the laboratory. In the constructed circuit, there is a unity gain non-inverting voltage follower between the instrumentation amplifier and the first filter. This is because the op amp ICs come in pairs of two, so the circuit must have an even number of op amps (not including the isolation amplifier).}
\label{fig:circuit}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In total, the gain of the ECG amplifier should be 1750. However, it is bad practice to apply all of the gain at a single amplification stage, so for this reason the gain is spread between the entire instrumentation amplifier and high pass filter. The first stage of the circuit, the instrumentation amplifier, was designed to have the following gain:
$$
G_1 = \frac{2R_2+R_1}{R_1}(\frac{R_4}{R_3})
$$
$$
G_1 = \frac{2(22k)+1.2k}{1.2k}(\frac{22k}{1k}) = 828.67.
$$
The gain of the second stage of the circuit, the high pass filter,  was designed by the following equation:
$$
G_2 = 1 + \frac{R_7}{R_6}
$$
$$
G_2 = 1 + \frac{10k}{10k} = 2.
$$
This gives a total gain of
$$
G_{total} = (G_1)(G_2) = (828.67)(2) = 1657.34.
$$

The final stage of the circuit, the Sallen-Key low pass filter, was designed for unity gain. However, special consideration had to be given to the component values in order to create Butterworth behavior. This means that the magnitude of the frequency response for the pass band is flat. A second order Butterworth filter in particular has a maximally flat passband. For the Sallen-Key filter in the ECG circuit, the following change of variables is made:
$$
R_8 = mR
$$
$$
R_9 = R
$$
$$
C_2 = mC
$$
$$
C_3 = C.
$$
The following variables are also defined:
$$
Q = \frac{\sqrt{mn}}{m+1}
$$
$$
\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0 = \frac{1}{RC\sqrt{mn}}.
$$
For a second order Butterworth, $Q = 1/\sqrt{2}$. It is also desired for the ECG application that $f_0 = 200$ Hz. Even with this information, there are too many variables to solve for both capacitor and both resistor values. Therefore, it is arbitrarily chosen that $m=1$, which implies $R_8 = R_9$. The choice of resistance value is again arbitrary, and here set as 10 k$\Omega$. Now the capacitance values can be solved for:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{n}}{2} \rightarrow n = 2
$$
$$
2\pi 200 = \frac{1}{(10k)C(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}})} \rightarrow C = C_3 = .0563 \mu F
$$
$$
C_2 = nC = .1126 \mu F.
$$
In practice, these values for the high pass capacitors were rounded to the closes standard values. The values that were used in the constructed circuit can be seen in Table \ref{table:values}.

In theory, the values of $R_{in}$ should be chosen such that the input impedance of the ECG amplifier circuit is sufficiently high. However, in practice if these values are too large, there is no signal seen at the output of the $R_{in}$ resistors. This is the reason for the value of 100 k$\Omega$ seen in Table \ref{table:values}.

\subsection{AC Analysis}

The final ECG circuit was simulated in two configurations in order to observe the direct mode (DM) and common mode (CM) signals. These two wiring schemes are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:DM_CM}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{DM_CM.png}
\caption{Schematic of the input configurations for measuring DM and CM signals.}
\label{fig:DM_CM}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

First, the DM signals were investigated. It is desired to have a large DM signal gain; the previous section demonstrated that the gain of the ECG amplifier circuit should be XX. Figure \ref{fig:DM} shows the response of the circuit for a range of relevant frequencies. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.35]{DM_analysis.png}
\caption{AC analysis of the simulated ECG amplifier circuit in DM measurement configuration. Notice the flat top of the magnitude spectrum. This is due to the use of a second order Butterworth filter.}
\label{fig:DM}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that within the range of about .4 - 100 Hz the DM signal is amplified by approximately 1750. This fits the original design requirement that the ECG amplifier have a DM gain of over 1000.

Figure \ref{fig:CM} shows the response of the circuit to CM signals over a range of simulated frequencies.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.35]{CM_analysis.png}
\caption{AC analysis of the simulated ECG amplifier circuit in CM measurement configuration.}
\label{fig:CM}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In this case, a very small gain is desired. The maximum gain of these signals from the designed circuit occurs in the frequency range of about .4 - 100 Hz, and the magnitude of the gain is approximately 0.00125. In order to calculate if this value is sufficiently small, one must compute the common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). This is the ratio of the DM gain to the CM gain, as seen below:
$$
CMRR = \frac{A_{DM}}{A_{CM}} = \frac{1656.4}{.0012045} = 1375176.42
$$
This value is sufficiently large, which means that the DM and CM gains of the designed circuit are appropriate.

Figure \ref{fig:3DB} shows the frequency response of the DM circuit again, this time with the magnitude plotted in dB. This is so that the $\pm$3 dB cutoff points are easier to identify. These corner frequencies are important to know because they correspond to the range over which the above CMRR is valid. Ideally, the upper and lower corner frequencies encompass the range of frequencies present in an ECG signal so that nothing of importance is attenuated during measurement.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.35]{3db_analysis.png}
\caption{AC analysis of the simulated ECG amplifier circuit in DM measurement configuration. The y-axis is plotted in decibels in order to easily find the $\pm$3dB cutoff frequencies. Cursors 1  and 2 are placed at the lower and upper corner frequencies, respectively.}
\label{fig:3DB}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
According to Figure \ref{fig:3DB}, the lower corner frequency occurs at .049 Hz and the upper corner frequency is at 164 Hz, which is sufficient to capture the majority of the frequency components of an ECG signal.
